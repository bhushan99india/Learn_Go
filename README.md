### Points to be remember in GO programing
1. Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.
2. A switch statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of if - else statements.
3. Switch without a condition is the same as switch true.
4. Pointer zero value is nil
5. Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.(perform operations like incrementing or decrementing the pointer, or even adding/subtracting integers to shift the pointer to different locations in memory.)
6. A struct is a collection of fields.
7. An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized
8. A slice, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array.
9. Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes.
10. The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.
11. The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.
